# WURM - Waze Update Request Marker

This is a more generalised version of WSLM (Waze Speed Limit Marker). 
If you don't know what WSLM was/is, it's a webapp to help Waze Map Editors to add/correct speed limits.

The purpose of WURM is to give more flexibility to Wazers and Map Editors out there, helping Waze to be even better.
